	<p><h4>The execution of programming language codes is done by a compiler. A compiler is given a set of codes or rather a sequence of codes that perform a desired task. The task may or may not be repetitive but the compiler is smart enough to process it.<br><br>Loop is a sequential set of instructions which gets executed multiple times to reduce minimize the repetition of code.<br><br>
In Python, we have two types of loops :<br>
i.	for loop<br>
ii.	while loop<br><br>
To understand the functioning and flow of a loop, you must get familiar with the term 'block'. A block is the smallest unit in a loop which performs one particular task.
