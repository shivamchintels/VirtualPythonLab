<h2><b>Aim :</h2><br><br> 

To make a user friendly virtual platform that provides opportunity for progressive learning and understanding the concepts of Python programming language.<br><br>


<h2><b>Learning Outcome :</b></h2><br><br>

With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn programming using Python language as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is beneficial in understanding the basics of a language which simply cannot be understood by self evaluation.<br><br>


<h2><b>Theory :</b></h2><br><br>

Python is considered as one of the simplest language in the programming world. It provides an interface with the help of which python can be used for Software Development, GUI Development, Web Development etc. Thus, making things easier for the programmer.<br><br>

Here, we have tried to make the experience memorable for the user.
The simulation helps a student in developing his programming skills effectively and efficiently. The basics will be cleared and any sort of confusion will be eradicated with the help of line by line execution display of the code.<br><br>


<h2><b>Procedure :</b></h2><br><br>

1.	Read the problem statement that is to be solved.<br>
2.	Get to the simulation section after going through the theory.<br>
3.	Enter the desired input that is mandatory for proceeding.<br>
4.	Follow the instructions mentioned in the manual.<br>
5.	The code of the problem will be generated with the help of which that problem will be solved.<br>
6.	Relevant line of will be highlighted to explain the execution of the code.<br>
7.	The output will be displayed in a separate panel along with the values of the objects used in it.<br>


<h2><b>Experiments :</b></h2><br><br>

1.	Basic Arithmetic Operations<br>
2.	Strings and methods <br>
3.	Built-in Functions<br>
4.	Loops<br>
5.	Data Types<br>
6.	Classes and Objects<br>
7.	Built-in modules<br>
8.	Constructor and Inheritance<br>
9.	File Operations<br>
10.	System Operations<br>
11.	GUI Applications<br>


<h2><b>Results and Output :</b></h2><br><br>

The main objective to develop this lab was to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose.<br><br>


<h2><b>Analysis and Discussion :</b></h2><br><br>

There might be some users who have a problem of generating logical statements by their own. Such will be taught the execution of code line by line which help them.<br>

There will be a dry run displayed in the Output panel that helps a student clear his doubts as well.<br>

Feedback is very essential to know the requirements and demands of the users. A feedback form will also be provided so that there could be a smooth function of upgradation and maintenance. <br><br>


<h2><b>Conclusion :</b></h2><br><br>

This lab could be beneficial for all the students who are facing difficulties in learning programming in Python. </b><br><br>
